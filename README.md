#### Methodology 

##### Summary & Intention

Committees are interested in gaining an understanding of the landscape of SBHCs and SBMHCs in NYC. This includes, but is not limited to, where and how they are sited and maintained as well as scope of services offered. The Committees are also interested in related data, including rates of utilization and any other types of data that may be collected. Additionally, the Committees are interested in what kind of outreach is conducted to inform students and their families about the existence of SBHCs and SBMHCs, any plans to expand access to their services, and whether continuity of care is ensured for students who graduate or transfer. Lastly, the Committees are interested in coordination efforts in the running of SBHCs and SBMHCs with regard to comparing outcomes and identifying best practices.

The data team examined student health reports submitted to the Council along with other publicly accessible information to gain insights into the locations and setups of SBHCs and SBMHCs in NYC.
